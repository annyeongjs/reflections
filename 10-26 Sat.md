Homework 2 was less challenging than previous homework simply due to the fact that we have done it before.
Everything about homework 1 was new to everyone, and had trouble finding way to do something eventhough it was a simple task.
However, since some of our group members including me had couple of midterms around last weekend, it was significantly harder to communicate and make a time for us to meet up.

Arif and Alex shared their ideas and solutions regarding creating google docs spreadsheet on github space.
Github also can serve as our space where class members could shair their ideas and help each other. 

Professor finally explained some details about the grading, which we all were curious about.
It is nice to finally know something about grading, as we had not much clue on it.
I would appreciate detailed grading distribution on the updated syllabus.

I have miseed lots of reflections in the beginning just becuase I was added late to this class and had no access to bspace.
I wasn't acknowledged on the reflection paper, and later I often missed the dead line.
I would like to try to write reflections on past lectures since I have taken note despite of being past due.

Thank you
