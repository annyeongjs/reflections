reflections
===========

We are to make our contributino more visible, otherwise it would not be appreciated.
On last thursday, we gathered as in horizontal group and discussed about the roadblocks that we encountered.

- Complexity: TED Video by Eric Berlow : Simplifying Complexity

  : Complex not equal to complicated

Visualizing complex model 

DC: Geographic, time period, Formats, Data sources
<-> Analyzer: ETAS Model, In points to model
<-> Visualizer: Graphs? Tools?-iphyton notebook, d3?
<-> Presenter: story, big picture, output format, presentation

Worry & Confusion -> Ambiguity & Questions-> Define -> Carver -> Smart Goals (Specific)

ETAS: Epidemic-Type After Shock

Title: Create a model simpler than ETAS that makes same or better predictions

SCEC/ Harvard CMT/ LUEN
-> Data, formats?, Json, kmz, xmc, 
-> ETAS, Matlab, code R -translate to ipython, MDAAS
-> Graphs, Charts, Visuals, Tools-R

I need to figure out what exactly we are supposed to do with the group and what role I would be doing.
