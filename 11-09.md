Reflection on 11-09 week.

SMART Goals: Office hour definitely helped. Although, our group met up to start on friday. 
We spent whole saturday and sunday to meet up and work on our task. We were not so sure what we were supposed to do.
Figuring out what to do was the hardest part and the most time consuming part of all. 

I more realized that how independent this class is to students, and I think it will be an unique and valuable experience to students.
I still need to understand more fully on the project we are doing, and try to contribute.
