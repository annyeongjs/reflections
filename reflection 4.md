Reflection 4

For some reason, I was one of few who did not have a stat 157 on bspace and was not aware of that we actually had a bspace. 
I came to realize that we should have 157 course on bspace only few days ago, and contacted bspace system management.

I did not have any reflection guideline until when I finally had stat 157 on my bspace. It looks like we still do not have a syllabus or schedule of homeworks or reflection.
Like what percentage of the grade would be on reflection, homeworks and group project and so on.

Since we do not have tentative schedule of homeworks or course, I am still not sure what exactly I have missed so far in this class.
I tried to google the procedure when I get stuck at something while installing stuffs, and mostly googling did a pretty good job with helping me.
However, in installing python notebook, it seemed like none of googling helped me.

Since I am quite behind everyone, I would need to get some help from other students in the group and GSI.
